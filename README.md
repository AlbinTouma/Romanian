# Romanian

The idea is to learn Romanian while also learning about different ways to store and surface data. My goals are to: 

(a) build language learning habits, 
(b) track language learning progress
(c) learn to use git to work on a projects from different computers 
(d) script bash or python files to update sheets automatically to github 
(d) build dashboards or tools that can trace langauge learning process
(e) build language learning tools

Resources in this depository include

-sentence_mining.csv this gsheet documents words and examples of sentences found in deep reading
-verbs.csv this gsheet documents verbs and conjugations
